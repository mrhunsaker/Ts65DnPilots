#Animals

In this study, 10 trisomic male Ts65Dn/DnJ mice and 10 age-matched wild type littermates were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and tested at 5-7 months of age, at an average weight of 33 +/- 3.8g (standard error). Animals were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle, in a temperature and humidity controlled environment with *ad libitum* access to food and water. All behavioral tests were conducted during the light portion of the cycle (06:00-18:00). Mice were housed in same-genotype groups of 2-3 per cage. Animal care and experimental testing procedures conformed to NIH, IACUC, and AALAC standards and protocols.

As detailed by Jackson Laboratory, the segmentally trisomic Ts<sup>(1716)</sup>65Dn mice have three copies of genes at the distal 15% of mouse chromosome 16 and span the region orthologous to genes on human chromosome 21. These extra genes, centromere, and about 5% of proximal mouse chromosome 17 are contained in the small extra chromosome derived from a reciprocal translocation. About 15% of the distal end of mouse chromosome 16 is fused to the centromeric end of chromosome 17 to form the small translocation chromosome. The translocation breaks mouse chromosome 16 just proximal to the amyloid precursor protein (*App*) gene and contains the chromosome 21-homologous genes from *App* to the telomere. The Ts65Dn/DnJ stock, commercially available from Jackson Laboratory, is homozygous for the wild type allele for retinal degeneration. The stock is maintained by repeated backcrossing of Ts65Dn females to B6EiC3H F1 hybrid males derived from a new congenic strain of C3H mice. This new congenic strain (C3Sn.BLiA-Pde6b+) lacks the blindness causing recessive mutant allele.

#Behavioral Tasks

The week prior to testing, all animals were handled in 15 min daily sessions and given an opportunity to habituate to the clear or red apparatus for at least 15 min and acclimate to sucrose pellet rewards. Each experimental session was separated by a minimum of 48 hours.

##Spatiotemporal Attributes

###Spatial

####Cheeseboard

Method:
Each mouse was habituated to the cheeseboard for 30 min the day prior to experimentation with food pellets distributed in each hole. At the beginning of each trial, a sucrose reward pellet was placed in one of the holes of the cheeseboard (in the midpoint of  the North-East, North-West, South-East or South-West quadrant). A mouse was then released at one of the cardinal points (*e.g.,* North, South, East, or West) as latency in seconds and distance in cm covered to reach the reward was recorded. Each day, the mouse received a trial from each of the four cardinal directions (order randomized between mice and between days within mice). There were 5 minutes separating each trial for each mouse. After the fourth day of training, the mice were given a probe trial wherein there was no reward. The search patterns of the mice were evaluated.

####Metric / Coordinate Processing

Method:
Each mouse had previously been habituated to the clear and red experimental boxes. For the metric/coordinate test, two objects were placed in the box separated by 25 cm (from inner edges) and mice were allowed to explore the objects for 15 minutes. After a 5 min interval during which the mice were covered by a heavy cup, the objects were moved closer together to an 8 cm separation and the mouse was allowed to explore for 5 min. This procedure was carried out in the clear box that allowed the mouse to see the extra-maze, distal cues as well as in the red box that blocked the ability of the mouse to see these cues.

####Topological / Categorical Processing

Method:
Each mouse had previously been habituated to the clear and red experimental boxes. For the topological/categorical test, four objects were placed in a square in the box separated by 25 cm (from inner edges) and mice were allowed to explore the objects for 15 minutes. After a 5 min interval during which the mice were covered by a heavy cup, the front two objects were transposed, and the mouse was allowed to explore for 5 min. This procedure was carried out in the clear box that allowed the mouse to see the extra-maze, distal cues as well as in the red box that blocked the ability of the mouse to see these cues.

####Location Recognition

Method:
Each mouse had previously been habituated to the clear and red experimental boxes. For the location recognition test, two objects were placed in the box separated by 25 cm (from inner edges) and mice were allowed to explore the objects for 15 minutes. After a 5 min interval during which the mice were covered by a heavy cup, one of the objects was moved at a diagonal to a new location (still 25 cm separation from the other object), and the mouse was allowed to explore for 5 min. This procedure was carried out in the clear box that allowed the mouse to see the extra-maze, distal cues as well as in the red box that blocked the ability of the mouse to see these cues.

##Temporal Attribute

####Temporal Ordering for Visual Objects

Method:
During session 1, two identical copies of a first object (object 1) were placed at the ends of the box 2.5 cm from the end walls and centered between the long walls. The mouse was placed in the center of the box facing away from both objects. The mouse was given 5 min to freely explore the objects. After 5 min, the mouse was removed to a small holding cup for 5 min. During this time, the first objects were replaced with two duplicates of a second object (Object 2). For Session 2, the mouse was again placed in the apparatus and allowed to explore. After 5 min, the mouse was removed to the holding cup for 5 min and the objects were replaced with two duplicates of a third object (Object 3). For Session 3, the mouse was given 5 min to explore. After 5 min, the mouse was removed into a small cup for 5 min and an unused copy of the first and an unused copy of the third object were placed into the box. The mouse was again placed into the box and allowed to explore the two objects (*i.e.*, Objects 1 and 3) during a 5 min test session. This procedure was carried out in the clear box that allowed the mouse to see the extra-maze, distal cues as well as in the red box that blocked the ability of the mouse to see these cues.

####Novelty Detection for Visual Objects

Method:
In addition to reflecting impaired temporal ordering, increased exploration of the first object over the third could also be interpreted as being due to difficulty in remembering the first object prior to the test session. To minimize and con- trol for such general memory deficits, a novelty detection of visual objects task was performed. Briefly, on a different day mice received three sessions during which they were allowed to explore three novel sets of objects (Objects 4, 5, 6) similarly to the temporal ordering tasks. During the test session, the first object and a novel fourth object (Object 7) were presented and the mice were allowed 5 min to explore.  This procedure was carried out in the clear box that allowed the mouse to see the extra-maze, distal cues as well as in the red box that blocked the ability of the mouse to see these cues.

##Sensory/Perceptual Attributes

####Feature Ambiguity

Method:
Each mouse had previously been habituated to the clear and red experimental boxes. For the configural recognition condition, mice were placed for 15 min in the red box containing two compound objects, AB and CD, separated by 15 cm. Following a 5 min delay under a heavy cup, the mouse underwent a 5-min Test Phase in which one object from the Study Phase remained the same (AB) and the other compound object is created from one component of each of the previous familiar objects, (*e.g.*, AD). That is, the “novel” object (AD) is composed of the same elements, but rearranged into a novel configuration. Therefore, the object is “novel” by virtue of its configuration, not by its elements, each of which is present in one of the compound stimuli in the habituation phase.Exploration of each compound object was scored as a single unit. A control task during which CD was replaced by two never before seen objects (EF) was also performed. This procedure was carried out in the clear box that allowed the mouse to see the extra-maze, distal cues as well as in the red box that blocked the ability of the mouse to see these cues.

####Object Recognition at 1 hour and 24 hour delays

Method:
Each mouse had previously been habituated to the clear and red experimental boxes. For the object recognition test, two objects were placed in the box separated by 25 cm (from inner edges) and mice were allowed to explore the objects for 15 minutes. After a 5 min interval during which the mice were covered by a heavy cup, one of the objects was replaced by a novel object that had never before been experienced byt he mouse, and the mouse was allowed to explore for 5 min. This procedure was carried out in the clear box that allowed the mouse to see the extra-maze, distal cues as well as in the red box that blocked the ability of the mouse to see these cues. This procedure was carried out in each box separately for delays of 1 and 24 hours.

##Executive Function

####Spontaneous Alternation

Method:
Mice were placed in the stem of a Y maze and allowed to explore. Whenever the mouse entered one of the arms of the Y maze with all four limbs their response was recorded. The number of times the mouse alternated (*i.e.,* did not repeat the previous turn), it was recorded as an alternation.

####Response Learning

Method:
Mice were placed in the stem of a Plus maze with one of the arms blocked off (forming a T maze). Mice were given five trials to determine if there was any preference for one direction over the other. As no such preference was observed, mice were randomly assigned the rule to turn right or turn left. Mice received 20 trials per day for 4 days. Entry into an arm with all four limbs was recorded as a choice and mice were not allowed to self correct when they made mistakes.

####Reversal Learning

Method:
The day after mice finished training on response learning, they received 80 trials of reversal training. This means that the turn the mice had just learned to make for reward was now incorrect, rather the mice had to make the opposite turn to receive reward.

---

##Motor Function

####Capellini Handling

Method:
Mice were habituated over a weekend to dried capellini pasts in their cages. Each mouse was placed in a 250 mL beaker and given a 5 cm piece of dried capellini. Their behaviors while eating were recorded for an offline analysis of their motor behaviors. Their latency to finish each piece of pasta was recorded, as were abnormal behaviors including the mouse having its paws together while eating, losing contact with the pasta with one or both paws, and using the mouth to pull the pasta rather than using the digits to feed the pasta into the mouth.

####Parallel Rung Walking

Method:
Mice were placed in a box measuring 15 cm squared with 1.5 mm diameter parallel rungs making up the floor. The mice were allowed to freely explore the box for 5 minutes. The number of times a paw slipped through the parallel rod floor beyond the wrist or ankle, a "foot slip" error was recorded. The total number of steps were also recorded to use as a normalizing factor.

---

##Adaptive Function

####Nesting Behaviors

Method:
Sawdust was used to fill a 10 cm long piece of 2" (~5 cm) diameter PVC pipe that was capped at one end. This pipe was placed in a cage with each mouse and the latency to contact the sawdust in the pipe, the latency to start digging in the sawdust, and the latency to finalize the nest were recorded.

####Neophagia

Method:
Mice were given three neophagia tests. The first was in their homecage. Each mouse was provided a food they had never encountered (Cheerios cereal) and the latcny to take the first bite was recorded. The second test was each mouse was placed on a large platter in a bright area int he testing room and the latency to take a bite from a reward pellet (familiar food) was recorded. The final test consisted of each mouse being placed in a novel white box and fed a Cheerio that had been stored with thyme overnight, resulting in a novel food. Again, latency to take the first bite was recorded.
