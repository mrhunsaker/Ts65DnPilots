Behavioral Pilot Data

Manuscript preprint at http://mrhunsaker.github.io/Ts65DnPilots

Behavioral Data in /Ts65Dn/Manuscript/Plots/* are plotted from the /Ts65DnPilots/Data folder.

As in the manuscript the data used for the plots are thus:
Fig 1 data in Ts65Dn/Data/Cheeseboard.csv and Ts65Dn/Data/Cheeseboard_Probe.csv
(Latency, Percent Latency, Distance, Percent Distance) and (Goal, Distance)
Fig 2 data in Ts65Dn/Data/DSBattery.csv
(LOCREC_RED,LOCREC_CLEAR,METRIC_RED,METRIC_CLEAR,TOPOLOGICAL_RED,TOPOLOGICAL_CLEAR,NOVEL_RED,NOVEL_CLEAR,TEMPORAL_RED,TEMPORAL_CLEAR)
Fig 3 data in Ts65Dn/Data/DSBattery.csv
(OBJECTREC_RED,OBJECTREC_CLEAR,OBJECTREC_24_RED,OBJECTREC_24_CLEAR,AMBIGUOUS_RED,AMBIGUOUS_CLEAR,AMBIGUOUS_CTRL_RED,AMBIGUOUS_CTRL_CLEAR)
Fig 4 data in Ts65Dn/Data/DSBattery.csv, Ts65Dn/Data/Response_learning.csv,  Ts65Dn/Data/Response_test.csv, and Ts65Dn/Data/Reversal_Factors.csv
(ALTERNATIONS) and (Percent_Correct) and (Raw performance with each subject as a column (0=wrong, 1=correct)) and (response_changepoints,response_perseverative,response_regressive)
Fig 5 data in Ts65Dn/Data/Capellini.csv and Ts65Dn/Data/DSLADDER.csv
(Latency,Atypical_Paw_Together,Atypical_NoContact,Atypical_Mouth_Pull,Sum_Atypical) and (Ladder_RAW, Ladder_ADJUSTED) - adjusted is foot slip probability / step
Fig 6 data in Ts65Dn/Data/Nesting.csv and Ts65Dn/Data/Hyponeophagia.csv
(latency_contact,latency_dig,latency_finish) and (latency_novelfood,latency_novelenvironment,latency_both)
